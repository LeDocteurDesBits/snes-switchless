This repository is an archive of an old project. It was an attempt to implement a CIC, an UIGR and a D4 patch in Verilog but I never took the time to finish this project.

* the code is ugly (that was my first Verilog project)
* the code is not commented
* the project has been tested on a Cyclone FPGA
* i used Quartus Prime to synthesize the project
